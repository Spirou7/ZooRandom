# ZooRandom
The strategy behind this project is to use live streamed data from zoos, such as the San Diego Zoo Library in order to generate random numbers.

# Milestones
- Figure out how to extract a frame from their LiveStream
- Figure out how to hash / turn into a random float between 0 and 1.
- Add the current time into the mix to add even more randomization?
- Then see if I can do it with multiple animals
- Finally determine the pdf of this random number generator
